# Roadmap State

## Phase

Primary-library foundation through Phase G is complete. Phase H is in progress: in-place Rekordbox doctoring.

## Last Done

H1 added `stage rekordbox-db-apply`, which converts reviewed cleanup apply manifests into staged Rekordbox `master.db` path updates and delegates install to the existing token-gated `install rekordbox-db` flow.

## Next

H2: convert files without losing cues, including real encode/delay compensation and ANLZ `.DAT`/`.EXT` cue updates.

## Phase-F Verification Results

- V-F1: installed encrypted suite ran 16 tests with 0 skips; minimal `PYTHONPATH` runs still skip cleanly, but installed environments fail if `pyrekordbox` or `sqlcipher3` is missing.
- V-F2: `sqlcipher3-wheels` binary wheels resolved for Ubuntu x64, current `macos-latest` arm64, and Windows x64 on Python 3.9 and 3.13. macOS Intel Python 3.13 was checked defensively and did not resolve a wheel, but GitHub's current `macos-latest` runner is arm64.

## Blockers

TestPyPI trusted publisher setup is a maintainer/account action:

1. Sign in to https://test.pypi.org as the owning account for `djlib-doctor`.
2. Go to Account settings -> Publishing -> Add a new pending publisher.
3. Use owner `pseudovirtual`, repository `djlib-doctor`, workflow name `release.yml`, and environment name `testpypi`.
4. Save the pending publisher for project name `djlib-doctor`.
5. In GitHub, ensure the repository has an environment named `testpypi`; no secrets are needed for trusted publishing.
6. Trigger the `Release` workflow with `workflow_dispatch` or push a pre-release tag such as `v0.1.0rc1`.
7. Confirm the `testpypi-smoke` job installs from TestPyPI and runs `djlib-doctor self-test` on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
